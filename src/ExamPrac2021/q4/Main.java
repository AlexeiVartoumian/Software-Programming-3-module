        /*
        Suppose b is:
        • a String array, or
        • an object of class java.util.ArrayList<String>, or
        • java.util.Set<String>.
        Then, one can write a foreach loop that processes each element of b as follows:
        for (String s : b) {
        // Process s
        }
        With each iteration of the loop, another element of b is stored in s and then
        “processed” — whatever that means.
        The use of such a foreach loop is made possible by the use of two interfaces:
        • Iterator, and
        • Iterable
        which provide an implementation of the Iterator design pattern.
        Write a class that implements the Iterator interface. An object of the class
        should be able to be used to enumerate the even values of an Integer array.
