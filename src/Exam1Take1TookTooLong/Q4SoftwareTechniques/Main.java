    The standard way to extend a software system is to find a suitable supertype and to subtype it.

You can also inherit behaviour by copying some of the operations of the first type and delegating calls to the other type.

Both of these extension techniques, however, require that you know at compile time what behaviour you want to add.

What are the two techniques that we have just described?
Grading comment:
Should one of these techniques be preferred to the other?

        Generics allow for creating classes without worrying about specific details about the elements that they contain an example of which is arrayLists.
Inheritance allows for borrowing attributes and behaviours of a base class for the code reuse.
in the general case Inheritance is quite a rigid implementation which may be suitable for groups of classes that share a common behaviour. Generics offer flexibility as to how we can implment this. As such the preference should be whichever approach is more suitable to a given situation
