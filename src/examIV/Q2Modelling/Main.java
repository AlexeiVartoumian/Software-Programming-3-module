        You are required to design an application for an advertisement company, which produces different sorts of publications such as books, articles, leaflets, etc. The company publishes those products in many media formats, such as printed material, pen drives, DVDs, online websites, etc. How would you model the company products hierarchy (Publications, Media)?
         */
        /*
        if the advertising company is the business domain then the publication are the properties of that domain and are the base units of operation.these units of operation can be modelled physically or digitally and I believe should be considered separately in each case.
a quick rendition of the heierarchy then would be publications at the top with  Physical publications on the one hand and on the other hand which the application willbe more concerned with is the digital aspect, where according to the type of media format a  corresponding file type can be matched to it and a tree structure exactly like a folder structure can be designed
