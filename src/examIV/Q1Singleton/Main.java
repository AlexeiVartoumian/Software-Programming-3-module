        /The Singleton design pattern defines a way to maintain only a single instance of a class in the entire execution of a program/application and to provide a uniform way to access it. There are numerous methods by which this pattern can be implemented. Provide the following implementations of this pattern:

        Eager Singleton [3 marks]
        Thread-Safe Singleton [5 marks]
        Double-checked Locking Singleton [8 marks]
        For all three, you may use the code in the file Main.java to test your solution (under the Q01 folder).
