        the three key features of oop are encapsulation , inheritance and polypmmorphism.
        In oop class based structures are used to organise code , which also allows for encapsulation which is
        information hiding. the goal behind information hiding is that clients of services only know about
        what they need , likely meaning the structure of the code itself is amenable to changes - an example of this
        is a class modeling a retail bank we would like to hide a customers bank details..
        Inheritance is how OOP is implemented in Java and C# as it allows for design patterns that OOP Solves for, ane example of this
        is a shared behaviour that could be abstracted for example we would like all animals of type mammal to obey a certain structure.
        Polymorphism is an extension of the above two , where at runtime of the program a class can adapt and serve the needs
        of a client in a certain scenario , this could be a implementation of different kinds of flying mechanisms say a bird or a plane.
