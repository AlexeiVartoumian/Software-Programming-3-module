        The following are examples of good programming practice:

i)   Do not use public instance variables.
A core tenet of OOP style is to promte encapsulation of information. its the philsophy of abstraction where two services/ functions
of code do not need to know how they execute thier role , they just know that they do it.
ii)  Use appropriate class, method and variable names.
removes the need the commenting code becomes self-explanatory when done well.
iii) Properly format source code.
its good etiquette.
iv)  Always initialise instance variables in a constructor.
paramaterizing instance varabiales offers a slight degree of decoupling of a given class with its properties
v)   A method should be cohesive.
it suits for a class that its method , its variables and everything about it is to serve a single responisiblity.
the aim is to be as atomic as possible in stucturing logic so that Solid principles can solve for the what-if scenario.
For each example, explain why.
