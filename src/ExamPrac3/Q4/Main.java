        Suppose there exists a method where a variable is passed in as a parameter. that variable will not be mutated
        by consequent operations unless the assign to it the value returned by that method call. in a pass by reference
        paradigm however the reference to the object in memory is passed into the function , meaning any operations done
        on the variable inside the function will mutate that variable outside the function.
